### ORDER TRACKER
This project is an attempt to create an order tracking app for my wife's tailoring bussiness.
The app should be able to lists orders both complete, ongoing, and those pending client confirmations. In additions the app should show the date and time when she started working on the order and  the same for when she completed the order.
Some extra feature will be:
    a) Cost of the project
    b) Asking price
    c) profit


App functionality/ features:
    1. saving orders
    2. displaying orders
    3. updating orders
    4. time stamping entries and updates
    5. deleting orders
    6. searching for an order from stored orders
