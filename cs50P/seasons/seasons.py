     program that prompts the user for their date of birth in YYYY-MM-DD
     format and then rints how old they are in minutes, rounded to the 
     nearest integer, using English words instead of numerals,  without 
     any and between words. Since a user might not know the time at which 
     they were born, assume, for simplicity, that the user was born at midnight 
     (i.e., 00:00:00) on that date. And assume that the current time is also 
     midnight. In other words, even if the user runs the program at noon, 
     assume that itâ€™s actually midnight, on the same date
