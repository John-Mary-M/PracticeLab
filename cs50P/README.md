In this directory i decided to go back to scratch and relearn the fundamentals of programming with python following the cs50p course from Havard.

Through the course i use my windows 11 machine and python3.11 but i use WSL as my terminal to run the programs and thus i am not limited by windows weeknesses.

3. Loops
