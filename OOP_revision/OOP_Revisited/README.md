###### In this directory I practice OOP from the basics following a 2 hour crash course from FreeCode Camp. 

Am using an example that assumes we are creating a program for a tech store that calculates discounts, and total prices of items bought.

After creating the all[] class attribute to access all instance attributes we go a head to use CSV (Comma Seperated Values) file to seperate the objects we create from the class. Reasons are to make code more neat, and also create kind of a data base with all the data seperate (Seperation of Concerns)
