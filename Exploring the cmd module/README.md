### THE CMD MODUDULE IN PYTHON

In this simple project I explore and learn about the cmd module from the python standard library and how to implement its features in my own applications.

The cmd module contains one public class, Cmd, designed to be used as a base class for interactive shells and other command interpreters.

## Major focuss
1. cmd line - Line Oriented Command Processors
        Processing Commands
        Command Arguements
        Live Help: Implemeting a help feature in the app
        Auto-completion
2. Overrinding Base Class Methods
3. Configuring Cmd through Attributes
