In the project we try to create our own shell with C. This is a parctice folder.

The final will be submitted in completion of our ALX SE shell project.

The Supper simple shell (dummyShellv1.c) is a main function that uses sys calls
to print a prompt for the user to enter a command. However at this stage,
the user has to enter a path to the command e.g. /bin/ls and this version doesnt
take arguemnt to a command yet.
