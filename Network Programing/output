Outgoing port tester

This server listens on all TCP ports, allowing you to test any outbound TCP port.


You have reached this page on port 80 (from http host header).


Your network allows you to use this port.
(Assuming that your network is not doing advanced traffic filtering.)


Network service: http
Your outgoing IP: 196.190.62.150
Test a port using a command

$ telnet portquiz.net 80 
Trying ...
Connected to portquiz.net.
Escape character is '^]'.


$ nc -v portquiz.net 80 
Connection to portquiz.net 80 port [tcp/daytime] succeeded!


$ curl portquiz.net:80 
Port test successful!
Your IP: 196.190.62.150

$ wget -qO- portquiz.net:80 
Port test successful!

# For Windows PowerShell users
PS C:\> Test-NetConnection -InformationLevel detailed -ComputerName portquiz.net -Port 80
Test a port using your browser

In your browser address bar: http://portquiz.net:XXXX


Examples: 
http://portquiz.net:8080 
http://portquiz.net:8 
http://portquiz.net:666 

Your browser can block network ports normally used for purposes other than Web browsing. In this case you should use the telnet or netcat commands to test the port.


Please also note that this server uses some port for real services (22, 25), so testing with your browser on those ports will not work.

Rate limiting

05/06/2020 : I had to set up Rate limiting on new connections by IP, otherwise the charge was too high for the small portquiz VM. Sorry for that.
