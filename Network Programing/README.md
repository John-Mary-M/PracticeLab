### Networked programs
In this directory i revise and learn more ways to work with python sockets, ports, etc

Sockets: provides 2 way connection between 2 programs. If you write something to the socket, it is sent to the application at the other end of the socket. If you read something from a socket, you are given the data which the other application has sent.
